# Overview
This is a program I wrote to further my understanding of RGB pixel manipulation of an image. And to better my understanding of writing object-oriented code.

I used python to read an image file and rewrite the image file to put over a red, green, blue, or gray filter depending on the user input. This is done by reading each pixel in the file and plugging it in to three different ratios to get the desired color over top the image without changing the original image color values.

# Development Environment
The environment I used for this is Visual Studio Code.

I wrote this in the python language with the Pillow Library to access the pixels and be able to manipulate the Image.

# Future Work
* Add more options for the user to choose from with more advanced filters.
* Incorporate object-oriented programming from the beginning of the code
* do more research to be able to have a more efficient code
